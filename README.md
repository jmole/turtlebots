## Getting Started

If you want to play turtlebots **without the distractions of other luanti/minetest mods** â€“ a common request for classroom use, there is a standalone game for Luanti that you can download and install here: [Turtlebots Classroom](https://github.com/jmole/turtlebots-classroom)

### Installing Luanti (formerly known as minetest)

Windows/macOS/Linux/Android users can all find detailed instructions for either installing or compiling Luanti from [the official website](https://www.luanti.org/downloads/).

### Installing the Turtlebots Mod

The easiest way to get up and running is:
1) Open Luanti
2) Click on the "Content" tab.
3) Click "Browse Online Content"
4) Search for "turtlebots"
5) Click the turtlebots mod in the search results
6) Click "Install"

Otherwise, you can install the mod manually by downloading or cloning the repository into your Luanti/minetest `mods` folder.

On windows, this is typically `%appdata%\.minetest\mods`. On Linux, this is typically `~/.minetest/mods`. On macOS, this is typically `~/Library/Application Support/minetest/mods`. Note that these folders won't exist until you have run Luanti at least once.

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/minetest/mods
git clone https://github.com/jmole/turtlebots.git
```

## How to Play Turtlebots

The turtlebots mod adds a new block called `turtlebots:off` to the game. You can find it in your creative inventory.

If you are using the [turtlebots-classroom game](https://github.com/jmole/turtlebots-classroom), it will automatically be in your hand when you start the game.

You can place a turtlebot on the ground by right clicking a node when you're holding it.

After it's been placed, right clicking the turtlebot will open the turtlebot code window GUI.

### How to Program a Turtlebot

The turtlebot code window GUI has a command palette on the left side, and a code block editor on the right.

To add commands to a program, simply click on the name of the program you want to modify, and click on the commands in the command palette.

Each row in the code block editor is a separate program. When **START** is pressed, the turtlebot will execute the program in the first row (the start program).

For example, the following program will do the following:

1) Call program `A`, moving the turtlebot forward 3 steps (1 +2)
2) Turn right 90 degrees.
3) Call program `A`, moving the turtlebot forward 3 steps (1 +2)
4) Turn right 90 degrees.
5) Call program `A`, moving the turtlebot forward 3 steps (1 +2)
6) Turn right 90 degrees.
7) Call program `A`, moving the turtlebot forward 3 steps (1 +2)
8) Turn right 90 degrees.
