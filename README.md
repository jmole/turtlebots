## A minetest programmable bot
Vbots are single block "turtle" style bots, programmable in an entirely visual way.
They came into existence to amuse my 5 year old daughters, and teach them the basics
of computer programming, without too much writing.

## Basics
Punch an idle vbot with an empty hand to make it run it's program (or click the run icon in the menu [see below]).

Punch a running vbot with an empty hand to stop the program.

Right click (double tap on android) to open the menu (see below).

Dig the bot by hitting it with anything except an empty hand, but bear in mind the bot can only be 
dug out if it's inventory is empty.
